# YouTube-Business-Contact-List-Builder

Description:
This project automates the process of building targeted business contact lists from YouTube. It scrapes and organizes channel details, including rank, Youtuber	subscribers, video views,	video count, category, and started

The tool identifies active YouTubers in specific niches by applying filters (e.g., 20k–100k subscribers, consistent uploads, 5k–10k+ average views), ensuring only high-quality channels are included. By prioritizing creators with the highest subscriber counts and engagement within the niche, the list is both accurate and valuable for outreach, lead generation, and market research.
