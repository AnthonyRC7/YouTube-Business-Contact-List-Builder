# YouTube-Business-Contact-List-Builder

Description:
This project automates the process of building targeted business contact lists from YouTube. It scrapes and organizes channel details including rank, subscribers, video views, video count, category, and channel start date, into a structured dataset.

The tool identifies active YouTubers in specific niches by applying filters (e.g., 20k–100k subscribers, consistent uploads, 5k–10k+ average views), ensuring only high-quality channels are included. By prioritizing creators with the highest subscriber counts and engagement within the niche, the list is both accurate and valuable for outreach, lead generation, and market research.

Technology Stack:

Selenium – for automated browsing and interaction with YouTube’s dynamic content.

BeautifulSoup (bs4) – for parsing and extracting structured data from HTML pages.

pandas – for cleaning, filtering, and organizing large datasets with ease.

xlsxwriter – for exporting the final dataset into Excel spreadsheets, making it easy to share and analyze.

NLTK – for natural language processing tasks such as categorizing channels, analyzing channel descriptions, and filtering niche-related keywords.

Together, these tools make the scraper not only robust and efficient but also capable of delivering clean, well-structured, and insightful contact lists tailored to business needs.
